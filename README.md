# LoanApprovalPrediction
I used ensemble learning techniques for predicting possible loan defaulters. Algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost. All these algorithms are used in the base stack and XGBoost is used as a meta model. For the User Interface I've used Flask and created a web application.
